# CS 165: Project 3
This project involves testing various graph algorithms on random graphs which are generated by the Erdos-Renyi algorithm.

# Motivation
This is based on the instructions for the third project of CS 165. How I am approaching the project is test-driven, with the tests being made first before
the sorts are applied onto the inputs. Each sort will be done on randomized input.

# Tech/Framework Used
**Build with:**
- C++
    - vector
    - map
    - ifstream
    - iostream
    - algorithm
    - chrono
    - cmath
    - cassert
    - queue
    - random
    - set
    - string
- Python
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
- LaTeX
- Bash

# Features
The project can generate a random graph from the Erdos-Renyi generation. There are also functions to get the following from a graph:
- the **diameter**, or the longest path in the graph
- the **cluster coefficient**, or the ratio of three times the number of triangles over the number of paths of length 2
- the **degree distribution**, or the number of vertices in the graph with that degree for each possible degree

# How to use?
Build with the makefile. Modify main.cpp if you want to change the parameters!

To utilize the actual algorithms, have the appropriate project3.h, graph.h, node.h, and utils.h along with the needed .cpp files for graph generation and functions.
